# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

##  Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

##  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

##  Program
```
a=input()
s=a[::-1]
if a==s:
    print("The entered string is palindrome")
else:
    print("The entered string is not palindrome")
```

## Result
Thus, the program to check whether a string is a palindrome in Python (without built-in functions) was executed successfully.
